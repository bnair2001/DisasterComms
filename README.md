#### Now let the fabled Gradle build run and get all the required SDKs mentioned in the gradle.build(app) file which your don't have to worry about until you want to achieve something crazy <br />

See something similar to this and you are good to go :) <br />

### Note:
##### The working of this app is dependent of [this](https://apkpure.com/netshare-no-root-tethering/kha.prog.mikrotik) app being present in your device.<br /> 
##### So definitely download this first before you use the DisasterComms app.<br /> 
##### This is the workaround we had to use inorder to have a ad-hoc like system.
